This code was shamelessly stolen from a collegue (who doesn't use
GitHub, otherwise I would mention them). I heard that it was a project
run by the Guardian, I haven't looked up what they did with it, but I
really like the idea so threw it into a web extension. Now I can see
it on every new tab!

Credit obviously to the Guardian and all the wonderful people who
helped source the quotes! And to Steve who wrote it!
